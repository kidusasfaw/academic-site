I am entering the final year of my graduate career and am actively looking for opportunities that line up with my interests.\nMy research has focused on building statistical inference methodology for nonlinear, non-Gaussian stochastic processes. My work has valuable applications in ecology, epidemiology, weather forecasting and target tracking. I am being advised by Edward Ionides and Aaron King.\nIn addition to my research interests, I am always eager to get better at being a disciplined applied statistician. How can I formulate my problems in a way that allows valid statistical analyses? What are included in my data and what aren\u0026rsquo;t? How might some models of the data-generating process help? How might they hurt? What can be learned from model estimation and hypothesis testing? How do I present my work to a broad audience? I\u0026rsquo;ve learned and taught a lot about these questions.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://kidusasfaw.github.io/academic-site/author/kidus-asfaw/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic-site/author/kidus-asfaw/","section":"authors","summary":"Hi there!
