title: "Analysis of Washington Post fatal police shootings data"
summary: "Can the circumstance of a fatal shooting by a police officer be used to predict race? Can it be used to predict whether the officer was wearing a body-camera? My team used machine learning techniques to visualize and answer such policy-affecting questions. Utilized methods including multi-class support vector machine (MSVM), logistic regression and random forest."
