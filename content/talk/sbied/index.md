summary: "This module introduced statistical inference techniques and computational methods for dynamic models of epidemiological systems."
abstract: "The course explored deterministic and stochastic formulations of epidemiological dynamics and developed inference methods appropriate for a range of models. Special emphasis was on exact and approximate likelihood as the key elements in parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and model selection. Specifically, the course covered sequential Monte Carlo and synthetic likelihood techniques."
