Hi there! My name is Kidus. I am a data scientist at Microsoft and I recently also received my PhD in statistics from University of Michigan. I currently work on projects that can loosely be bucketed in 
machine learning and time series analysis. I consider myself a lifelong learner and am currently going through Frank Harrell, Jr.'s Regression Modeling 
Strategies.

My research while in graduate school focused on building statistical inference methodology for nonlinear, non-Gaussian stochastic processes. I also worked on an R package called 
[spatPomp](https://kidusasfaw.github.io/spatPomp) where I implemented new and existing methods. My work has valuable applications in ecology, epidemiology, 
weather forecasting and target tracking. I was advised by [Edward Ionides](https://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~ionides/) and [Aaron King](https://kinglab.eeb.lsa.umich.edu/king/).

I am always eager to get better at being a disciplined applied statistician (these days, I am going through Frank Harrell, Jr.'s Regression Modeling
Strategies) . How can I formulate my problems in a way that allows 
valid statistical analyses? What are and 
aren't included in my data? How might some models and methods help or hurt in getting an answer to real-life and business problems? How do I present my work to a 
broad audience? I've learned and thought a lot about these questions.
